    <h2>Barca Fanzone Project Proposal</h2>
    <p>
      The Barca Fanzone is an interactive platform enabling fans to obtain club news alongside achievements and transfer information. Through this website, all fans will discover one place to engage with the club's activities and share ideas while conducting discussions. The platform will use AI-based technology for an automated chat function that offers quick match data and helpful responses to fan queries while improving user exchanges. A blog section with fan-generated content combines discussion forums and an achievement gallery among the website features targeting FC Barcelona fans.
    </p>
    <p>
      The infrastructure will operate from Amazon EC2 (IaaS) because it provides scalable and flexible services at cost-efficient rates. The infrastructure control enables users to configure their systems according to increasing fan community requirements. The website development will use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript programming languages and include a responsive design that works appropriately on various devices. MySQL will be used as its database solution to store user information with forum messages and blog content safely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The primary purpose of this project is to build an interactive platform that serves FC Barcelona fans worldwide. The Barca Fanzone will mobilize fan community ties through live event notifications, active debate areas, achievement collections, and storage functions. The website benefits from Amazon EC2 because it allows for smooth user base expansion without compromising performance or reliability.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project fulfills the learning objectives of ICT171 by establishing a server through IaaS deployment, managing infrastructure, and building a functional website. The project enables students to study cloud-based hosting solutions and their benefits compared to conventional hosting approaches.
